## Usage

This is good practice for me When joining a new team at a company. I am expected to inspect a lot of code that I have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for me, I will dissect the code by myself, saving any questions for a member of my team.

## Installation

To run this, you will need to isntall your dependencies 

```
npm i
```
